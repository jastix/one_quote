  \ You're talking about Goethe's Faust! \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: And at one stage
  early on, he wavers and wonders if he should ask god for forgiveness, so to sway
  him back lucifer puts puts on a show, with the seven deadly sins appearing in their
  true demonic form before him.   \r\n< apo> Actually... \r\n< apo> He's making a
  bet with Mephistopheles \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: Quite possibly! \r\n< TwoDaemon>
  apo: Not in the play. \r\n< TwoDaemon> apo: And believe me, I should know, I've
  now seen it three times. \r\n< apo> He says that if Mephi can make him say- oh,
  never mind. \r\n< TwoDaemon> In the play, Faustus straight up trades, signing a
  contract in his own blood.  Anyway. \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: So, we had this thing,
  with seven people dressed up as demons representing the sins, separate coloured
  spotlights picking out each one and all. \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: And Meph, Lucifer
  and so on standing off to one side.   \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: Now, the script calls
  for miss Lechery to basically put her arm around and mock-seduce Meph, just in a
  very minor way at the edge, for a character thing.  This is while the other demons
  are introducing themselves one by one. \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: She's last, see.
  \r\n * April nods \r\n< April> Miss Lechery, hee \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: Except
  this particular Lechery is played by a rather odd girl, who has (and this is important)
  also spent a dark and sticky night with he who plays Meph.   \r\n< TwoDaemon> April:
  As in, last night. \r\n< April> Wait, in real life??? \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: (This
  is general knowledge, since she went on about it quite a lot before performance)
  \ Yes, in real life. \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: Apparently she's a bit of a... well,
  she gets around a lot. \r\n< April> oooooh scandelous! \r\n< TwoDaemon> Anyway.
  \ So, the scene begins, and whatnot.  And then this whispering begins to spread
  across the crowd.  Now, in my position I can't really see the stage, because there's
  no follow spot at the moment so I'm leaning back. \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: And then
  it comes over cans (communication stuff between all the techs) \r\n< TwoDaemon>
  April: 'Oh god, what is she doing?   \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: 'She's undoing his
  shirt... why is she undoing his shirt?' \r\n< April> NO WAY \r\n< TwoDaemon> April:
  At this point, as you might imagine, I lean forwards to find out what the fuck is
  going on. \r\n< April> Haha right \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: Lady Lechery is running
  her hands down Meph's now bare chest.  I still can't see too well from my position,
  but from cans comes 'Oh god, she's making him touch her...' \r\n< April> HAHA, this
  is awesome \r\n< April> What did the director say? \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: And then,
  just to top things, 'Did she just put her hand on his...?  She just grabbed his
  crotch.  Oh, fuck...' \r\n< April> HAHA wow \r\n< April> Was this the last show?
  \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: That's as far as she got, although possibly only because
  she was distracted by her cue to introduce herself. \r\n< April> wow \r\n< TwoDaemon>
  The last one, not five hours ago, yeah. \r\n< TwoDaemon> The director hella chewed
  her out. \r\n< April> Yeah I was going to say \r\n< April> what was the aftermath?
  \r\n< TwoDaemon> Just for added fun, the entire audience most certainly noticed
  and we also had a couple of reviewers from the local student paper in the crowd.
  \r\n< TwoDaemon> April: So, yeah, that was an interesting time.  The other techs
  were debating as to whether she was actually gonna rip his clothes off and have
  her way with him right on stage. \r\n< TwoDaemon> Of course, just for fun, guess
  who else was in the crowd? \r\n< TwoDaemon> Meph's mother.  "

  nobody; andrew knows the birthday girl, that's about it \r\nkhmer: the hosts are
  a pair of mid-20s IT workers from japan, and 80% of the guest list is japanese exchange
  students, around my age \r\nkhmer: most of them FOB or close, going to various schools
  in the area \r\nkhmer: their english is pretty good but heavily accented and not
  high on vocabulary \r\nkhmer: they're dressed trendy, lots of denim, hair highlights,
  you get the idea \r\ncreature: Does this story end with you seducing someone?  \r\nkhmer:
  swarms of japanese girls, and you know, i just automatically think they probably
  have relatively innocent schoolgirl sensibilities; too much western entertainment
  i guess \r\nkhmer: but we're out on the balcony smoking and then being openly asked
  about the size of our dicks \r\nprozac: bwahahahaahahahaha \r\nkhmer: 'oh, miyuki
  and me, we knowww tall boys! hee hee hee!' \r\nzylche: squelch.. \r\nkhmer: 'i want
  to stay in seattle parliamentary' \r\nkhmer: 'what?' \r\nkhmer: 'parliamentary!'
  \r\nkhmer: 'like, forever!' \r\nkhmer: 'but it's very hard, you know, visa, and
  green card' \r\nkhmer: 'oh you mean permanently! ah, i see' \r\nkhmer: 'yes,' says
  miho, 'long time, lots of paperwork' \r\nkhmer: i nod sympathetically, she says
  'or i could marry someone!' \r\nColdcell: send her over. \r\nkhmer: i know, right?
  but jeff and andrew and i don't flirt overtly, because we're off balance a bit,
  this has all come as a bit of a surprise, and we're afraid of a huge cultural misunderstanding
  \r\nColdcell: khmer, that's a 'bow' not an invite to unzip \r\nprozac: khmer, there
  was a huge cutural misunderstanding \r\nprozac: japanese arent puritianical like
  western society. \r\nkhmer: like, we were afraid we'd end up in the bedroom, we're
  like, yes, score, inside-the-park, and she would, i dunno, pull out hungry hungry
  hippos as we were getting our pants offf \r\nColdcell: hahaa \r\nkhmer: so, yes,
  considering among other things the cultural gaps you two are pointing out, we made
  sure not to flirt with anyone heavily \r\nColdcell: 'oh, I totally play HH in the
  nude, don't you know Americans?' \r\nkhmer: but we definitely get real full of ourselves
  \r\nkhmer: we end up sitting inside in front of like 12 japanese kids, doing stupid
  elementary school tricks \r\nkhmer: like, jeff played the william tell overture
  with his mouth, i opened a beer can with a lighter \r\nkhmer: THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE
  EVERY TIME \r\nkhmer: we recited the who's on first routine \r\nkhmer: RIOTOUS LAUGHTER
  \r\nEphphatha: opening a beer can with a lighter? \r\nkhmer: we could do no wrong!
  it made me understand why has-been bands go play japan! \r\nkhmer: beer bottle,
  that is \r\nkhmer: excuse me \r\nkhmer: you know, absence of verbal humor, we're
  like... \r\nkhmer: getting peals of laughter from making shapes with our tongues
  \r\nkhmer: 'look! a tube!' \r\nkhmer: so i get a quarter out of my pocket and i
  grab miyuki, who is heartbreakingly gorgeous \r\nprozac: I'm wondering about how
  you didn't get laid after all this.... \r\nkhmer: i press the quarter to my forehead,
  it sticks there, i hit myself in the back of the head twice, it falls off \r\nkhmer:
  she understands \r\nkhmer: so, i press it to her forehead, and, you guys know the
  trick, right? i remove it as i pull my hand away \r\nkhmer: enthusiastically, she
  begins hitting herself in the back of the head \r\nkhmer: one time...two times...three...harder...harder...HARDER
  \r\nkhmer: TWELVE TIMES \r\nkhmer: she's getting FURIOUS \r\nkhmer: another party
  guest comes into the room \r\nkhmer: she yells something at him in japanese, glares
  \r\nkhmer: he's like...uh...are you...are you sure? \r\nkhmer: it's gonna hurt real
  bad \r\nkhmer: she nods frantically \r\nEphphatha: you're mean \r\nkhmer: Ephphatha
  i was BEGGING her to feel her forehead with her hand \r\nkhmer: after like the sixth
  smack \r\nkhmer: she wouldn't LISTEN \r\nkhmer: i was FLIPPING THE QUARTER IN MY
  HAND \r\nkhmer: LOOK MIYUKI IT'S THE QUARTER \r\nkhmer: MIYUKI STOP THIS \r\nkhmer:
  so she demands that this dude hit her \r\nkhmer: and he does \r\nkhmer: so hard
  she FALLS OVER \r\nEphphatha: hahaha \r\nkhmer: gets up, and looks mortified \r\nkhmer:
  she heard no quarter drop \r\nkhmer: so i grab her and put her hand on her forehead
  \r\nkhmer: realization breaks out over her face \r\nkhmer: her eyes widen, and then
  \r\nkhmer: she JAMS ME INTO A CORNER AND BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF ME \r\nkhmer: i'm
  cowering for my LIFE \r\nkhmer: she's screaming and hitting me with closed fists,
  REALLY HARD \r\nEphphatha: I'm nearly pissing myself laughing at this \r\nkhmer:
  so, i notice after a few seconds of this \r\nkhmer: the blows are falling softer
  and less often \r\nkhmer: she's...she's laughing! ha! all is forgiven! \r\nkhmer:
  the room begins to chuckle, the trance recedes \r\nkhmer: then she stops DEAD SILENT
  \r\nkhmer: spins around and GLARES at the guy who hit her really hard \r\nkhmer:
  and BEATS THE FUCK OUT OF HIM \r\nkhmer: KICKS, PUNCHES \r\nkhmer: he's MOANING
  FOR MERCY \r\nkhmer: her friends have to restrain her \r\nkhmer: and then suddenly
  she BURSTS OUT LAUGHING and laughs for like THREE MINUTES \r\nshoofle: that's a
  great story \r\nkhmer: and then she turns to me and says 'you like jazz?' \r\ncreature:
  Congratulations! You pulled a crazy girl. \r\nkhmer: ...the end \r\nprozac: khmer,
  she'd do wild things to you in the bedroom. \r\nEphphatha: ok, if I EVER go to a
  party with you, you're not allowed to have any coins \r\nprozac: Ephphatha, you
  should give him several \r\nkhmer: prozac: i thought about trying to bag her, but...i
  had a magic:the gathering tournament in the morning \r\nprozac: just dont hit anyone
  in the back of the head \r\nColdcell: khmer, you're a living legend\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

  paranormal events. And he had already heard that I've run into some stuff a bit
  like that (most likely just sleep paralysis related hypnogogic stuff). So he is
  saying \"damn it, you better not be bringing any of that here\", all half joking
  \r\n<@snark> anyway, so we go out to grab some food, and we get back to the apartment,
  we go in through the back door, and as he's finding his keys I surreptitiously ring
  the doorbell \r\n<@snark> which is very rarely used, and it's an old crappy apartment
  \r\n<@snark> so he's like \"wait, is that our doorbell?\" \"Uh, I'm not sure.\"
  It rings again. \"I think that's our doorbell!\" He opens the door, it rings again.
  \r\n<@snark> So he assumes it's coming from the front door, grabs a saucepan from
  the kitchen, storms over to the front door and opens it \r\n<@snark> of course there's
  nobody there. We're all looking up and down the street. I decide to ring the front
  doorbell while he's not looking, just to freak him out a bit more \r\n<@snark> and
  here's the great bit \r\n<@snark> the front doorbell does not function. \r\n<@snark>
  So I'm like \"Uh... I don't know how it happened, but our doorbell doesn't even
  work. Look. I'm pressing it repeatedly. I don't know how it rung just now, but it
  wasn't from someone pressing this button.\" \r\n<@snark> now he's really pretty
  freaked out. Not much more is mentioned about it, but we're watching some other
  movie,  and he'll stop and be like \"what is that thing with like the valley of
  death? That's from the bible, right?\" and things of this nature \r\n<@snark> I'm

  \r\n<Antimony-120> Now, the rule is that she (the mother) doesn't mind the fact
  that her daughter (my gf) is getting laid, so long as it isn't while she (the mother)
  is in the building. Same with all her children apparently, it just weirds her out.
  \r\n<Antimony-120> So Saturday night we (the gf and I) are watching a movie in her
  room. And we start making out. After awhile the gf says \"Hey, it's my house. As
  long as we're quiet...\" \r\n<Antimony-120> Like magic the mother pops by and asks
  about what wine she should pick up at the store, makes a crack about \"Just remember,
  no unf unf with the mum around\". \r\n<Antimony-120> Keep in mind this is literally
  SECONDS after \r\n<Palomides> she has the room bugged \r\n<Antimony-120> But hey,
  the mother is going out, so we start going and are getting along. Then, footsteps
  on the stairs, we dive under the covers and pretend we were watching a movie \r\n<Antimony-120>
  it was the best we could come up with at the time \r\n<Antimony-120> she walks in
  \"Forgot my car keys\" \r\n<Antimony-120> turns, walks halfway out, and sees my
  underwear on the dresser \r\n<Antimony-120> walks over, PICKS THEM UP, says \"Well,
  at least there's no skidmarks, have fun\", and walks out. \r\n<Palomides> :| \r\n<Antimony-120>
  Next day at breakfast, somewhat awkward conversation, then she says: \"Oh, and remind
  me never to let you two watch a movie while I'm around, that was close\" \r\n<Antimony-120>
  the gf is somewhat annoyed with her mother about this (it being the gf's house she
  feels she can do whatever she wants, which I can appreciate) \r\n<Antimony-120>
  says: \"Close? How do you know we weren't going at it like rabbits!\" \r\n<Antimony-120>
  the mother, doesn't even look up, \"honey, if he can keep it up while thinking about
  skidmarks you have more serious issues to worry about\" \r\n<Antimony-120> in conclusion:
  Well played madam, well played \r\n<Boom_Farmer> Antimony-120: That is amazing.

  shower. I was invited, because my sister likes getting presents. I got them Hungry
  Hungry Hippos. The reason for this? My brother-in-law, when young, was a terror,
  and his mother was an actual single mother. The father left the day of conception.
  \r\nKBC: One day, his mother got fed up with my brother-in-laws antics, she said
  'That's it, grab one toy, you're going to the orphanage!' So he grabs HHH, they
  walk around a mall a bit, he's clutching that thing to him saying 'I *sob* Don't
  *Sob* wanna *sob* go to the orphan*sob*age!' \r\nKBC: And then they go home. But
  this story isn't about my brother-in-law, or his mother, or even my nephew, really.
  It's about the baby shower, when I went out to buy their gift- Hungry Hungry Hippos.
  \r\nKBC: I go to Walmart, because it's the only thing open at the time I went out.
  I go to the toy section, look at the Lego, crappy excuse for action figures, then
  grab the game. After that, I start heading for the cash registers. \r\nKBC: On the
  way towards the cashes, I pass the pharmacy and realize, 'Hey, I need condoms.'
  Because, well, condoms expire after four years. So, I grab a box of condoms, Tiny
  Trojans (they invaded in a pony, not a horse) and head to the cashes with my HHH
  in tow. \r\nKBC: While waiting at the cash, I see their impulse buys. Impulse buy
  at this cash was gummy bears. This reminded me about a story I heard that eating
  too many gummy bears can turn your pee black. So I picked up some. For science.
  (Post-script: It didn't) \r\nKBC: I'm waiting for the cashier, and there's two people
  in front of me. The cashier is this old, 80 or older blue haired bat who likes talking.
  She rung the items up for the people in front of me and talked to them for a few
  minutes, despite their wanting to pay and leave. And then I get served. \r\nKBC:
  She looks at me and smiles, then looks at my items. Then looks at me. And looks
  at my items. And then just glares at me. I'm standing right in front of her, after
  a long 12 hour shift, in a trenchcoat, not having shaved for a week. That's when
  it hits me, I just won the condom game, where you grab three items, one being condoms,
  and see if you can get a reaction. You know, coathanger, garbage bags, condoms.
  Something like that. \r\nKBC: By the way she's looking at me, she must think I'm
  a child molester. So I say to her. 'Oh, uh, I'm new in town...do you know where
  I can get a white, panelled van?' And her jaw drops. She scans the items, as she
  hadn't yet, as fast as fast can be, I give her the money and she pretty much throws
  it back at me. \r\nKBC: I thank her for her service, and start to leave the store.
  Before I leave, I look back, and I see her, on the phone, looks like she's yelling,
  using her hand beside her to try and judge height next to her, probably giving my
  description to someone. And that's why I'm not allowed at the east end Wal-mart
  again. END."
